# Animated Search Bar Toggle

This is a beginner-friendly project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It creates an **animated search bar** that expands and collapses when clicking the magnifier icon. The project helped me practice **CSS transitions** and **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.

## 🚀 Features

- Beginner-friendly code with simple structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
